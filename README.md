# Learning elm

These are my notes on learning Elm

## General workflow

    elm package install

This will "install" the core elm libraries to the directory you are in.

    elm package install evancz/start-app

This installs "start app" which is a MVC-esque framework for Elm.

It uses the "Elm Architecture" pattern.

## What is the Elm architecture?

- https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/

*Model, view, update*


## Exercise 1

### Purpose
Just a simple example of elm architecture, showing a button which toggles the casing of a string

*Model* - A string and it's current case
*View* - A h1
*Update* - Toggle.

## Exercise 2
